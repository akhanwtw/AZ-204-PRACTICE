📌 Question 221
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You plan to develop an Azure Functions app with an HTTP trigger.

The app must support the following requirements:
*   Event-driven scaling
*   Ability to use custom Linux images for function execution

You need to identify the app’s hosting plan and the maximum amount of time that the app function can take to respond to incoming requests.

Which configuration setting values should you use?

**Configuration Settings:**
1.  **Hosting Plan:** [Consumption | Dedicated | Premium]
2.  **Timeout value:** [230 seconds | 10 minutes | unlimited]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
✅ Correct Answer
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  **Hosting Plan:** Premium
2.  **Timeout value:** 230 seconds

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📝 Explanation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**1. Hosting Plan: Premium**
*   **Ability to use custom Linux images:** While you can run code on Linux in the Consumption plan, you cannot bring your own **custom Docker container** (Custom Image). Custom images are supported only in the **Premium** (Elastic Premium) and **Dedicated** (App Service) plans.
*   **Event-driven scaling:** The **Dedicated** plan scales based on App Service Plan rules (manual or autoscale based on metrics like CPU), not typically described as "event-driven" in the Azure Functions context. The **Premium** plan, however, offers the same event-driven scaling model as Consumption (adding instances based on trigger events) while also supporting custom images.
*   **Conclusion:** The **Premium** plan is the only one that satisfies both requirements.

**2. Timeout value: 230 seconds**
*   The question specifies an **HTTP trigger**.
*   Regardless of the hosting plan (Consumption, Premium, or Dedicated) or the `functionTimeout` setting in `host.json`, Azure Functions hosted in Azure sit behind the **Azure Load Balancer**.
*   The Azure Load Balancer has a fixed, non-configurable idle timeout of **230 seconds** (3 minutes and 50 seconds).
*   If an HTTP-triggered function takes longer than 230 seconds to send a definitive response, the Load Balancer closes the connection, and the client receives a timeout error (HTTP 502/504).
*   Therefore, the maximum time the app can take to *respond* to the incoming HTTP request is **230 seconds**.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
✅ Correct Answer
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**A. Yes**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📝 Explanation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The correct ANSWER is **Yes**.

1.  **Enabling Ingress:** The primary issue stated is that users are "unable to access" the app. By definition, if ingress is disabled in Azure Container Apps,

📌 Question 223
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This question requires that you evaluate the underlined text to determine if it is correct.

Your Azure Active Directory Azure (Azure AD) tenant has an Azure subscription linked to it.

Your developer has created a mobile application that obtains Azure AD access tokens using the OAuth 2 implicit grant type.

The mobile application must be registered in Azure AD.

You require a <u>redirect URI</u> from the developer for registration purposes.

Instructions: Review the underlined text. If it makes the statement correct, select `No change is needed.` If the statement is incorrect, select the answer choice that makes the statement correct.

- A. No change required.
- B. a secret
- C. a login hint
- D. a client ID

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
✅ Correct Answer
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**A. No change required.**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📝 Explanation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The correct ANSWER is **No change required.**

**Why "Redirect URI" is correct:**
When registering an application in Azure Active Directory (now Microsoft Entra ID) that uses OAuth 2.0 flows (such as the Implicit Grant type used here), defining a **Redirect URI** (also known as a Reply URL) is mandatory.
*   The Redirect URI is the specific location where the authorization server sends the user after the app has been successfully authorized.
*   In the **Implicit Grant flow**, the access token or ID token is returned directly to this URI (often in the URL fragment). If this URI is not registered in the Azure portal, the authentication request will fail for security reasons.
*   For a mobile application, this is often a custom scheme (e.g., `myapp://auth`) or a verified HTTPS link.

**Why the other options are incorrect:**
*   **B. a secret:** Mobile applications are considered "Public Clients" because they cannot securely store secrets (the code is distributed to user devices). Consequently, the Implicit Grant flow (and the modern Authorization Code flow with PKCE) does NOT use a client secret. Adding a secret would be insecure.
*   **C. a login hint:** A `login_hint` is an optional parameter sent by the application *during* the authentication request (at runtime) to pre-fill the username field. It is not a configuration setting required to *register* the app in the portal.
*   **D. a client ID:** The Client ID (Application ID) is a value that is **generated by Azure AD** when the registration is created. The developer does not provide this to you; rather, you (the admin) provide the generated Client ID to the developer after registration so they can configure their code to identify itself.

📌 Question 224
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are configuring a web app that delivers streaming video to users. The application makes use of continuous integration and deployment.

You need to ensure that the application is highly available and that the users' streaming experience is constant. You also want to configure the application to store data in a geographic location that is nearest to the user.

Solution: You include the use of an Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) in your design.

Does the solution meet the goal?

- A. Yes
- B. No

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
✅ Correct Answer
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**A. Yes**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📝 Explanation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The correct ANSWER is **Yes**.

Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) is specifically designed to solve the challenges described in the scenario:

**1. Constant Streaming Experience & High Availability:**
CDNs are distributed networks of servers capable of handling massive loads. By caching video content on edge servers, the CDN minimizes latency and buffering (jitter), providing a smooth and constant streaming experience even during high-traffic events. Azure CDN interacts efficiently with Azure Media Services and Blob Storage to deliver video content.

**2. Geographic Proximity (Data Storage):**
The core function of a CDN is to cache content at "Point of Presence" (PoP) locations around the world. When a user requests a video, the request is routed to the nearest edge server. This effectively "stores" the data closer to the user to minimize network travel time (latency), meeting the requirement to store data in a geographic location nearest to the user.

📌 Question 225
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are developing a solution for a public facing API.

The API back end is hosted in an Azure App Service instance. You have implemented a RESTful service for the API back end.

You must configure back-end authentication for the API Management service instance.

Solution: You configure Client cert gateway credentials for the Azure resource.

Does the solution meet the goal?

- A. Yes
- B. No

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
✅ Correct Answer
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**A. Yes**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📝 Explanation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The correct ANSWER is **Yes**.

When securing the connection between Azure API Management (APIM) and a backend service (like Azure App Service), **Client Certificate Authentication** (Mutual TLS) is a standard and highly secure method.

1.  **How it works:** You upload a client certificate to Azure API Management. Then, in the APIM "Gateway credentials" configuration (or via policy), you instruct APIM to present this certificate when making requests to the backend.
2.  **App Service Configuration:** On the Azure App Service side, you configure it to require incoming client certificates and validate that the certificate presented matches the one from APIM (usually by checking the thumbprint or subject).
3.  **Result:** This ensures that the App Service only accepts traffic that originates from your specific API Management instance, effectively solving the "back-end authentication" requirement.

**Note:** While other methods exist (like Managed Identity), Client Certificates are a valid and supported solution for this requirement.

📌 Question 226
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are a developer at your company.

You need to update the definitions for an existing Logic App.

What should you use?

- A. the Enterprise Integration Pack (EIP)
- B. the Logic App Code View
- C. the API Connections
- D. the Logic Apps Designer

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
✅ Correct Answer
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**B. the Logic App Code View**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📝 Explanation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Why "Logic App Code View" is correct:**
The "definition" of a Logic App refers to the underlying JSON structure that describes the workflow's triggers and actions using the **Workflow Definition Language (WDL)**. While you can modify the workflow visually using the Designer, referring specifically to "updating the definitions" typically implies interacting with this source JSON directly. The **Code View** in the Azure Portal (or VS Code) provides the editor to modify this JSON definition manually.

**Why others are incorrect:**
*   **A. Enterprise Integration Pack (EIP):** This is used for B2B scenarios, enabling capabilities like processing XML messages, EDI encoding/decoding, and managing integration accounts/artifacts. It is not a tool for editing the Logic App definition itself.
*   **C. API Connections:** These are Azure resources that store authentication and configuration data for the connectors used in your Logic App (e.g., connection strings for SQL, tokens for Office 365). Editing these updates the connection details, not the workflow logic definition.
*   **D. Logic Apps Designer:** This is the visual interface for building workflows. While using it specifically updates the underlying definition, it is an abstraction layer. When the requirement implies working directly with the "definitions" structure (often for fine-tuning properties not exposed in the GUI or copying JSON), Code View is the precise tool.

📌 Question 227
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are developing a solution for a public facing API.

The API back end is hosted in an Azure App Service instance. You have implemented a RESTful service for the API back end.

You must configure back-end authentication for the API Management service instance.

Solution: You configure Client cert gateway credentials for the HTTP(s) endpoint.

Does the solution meet the goal?

- A. Yes
- B. No

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
✅ Correct Answer
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**A. Yes**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📝 Explanation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Why this solution works:**
The goal is to secure communication between Azure API Management (APIM) and the backend Azure App Service (Backend Authentication). Mutual TLS (mTLS) using client certificates is a standard and secure supported method for this scenario.

1.  **APIM Configuration:** In API Management, you can modify the **Backend** settings (specifically under **Gateway credentials**) to select "Client cert". This tells APIM to present a specific certificate when authenticating against the backend service.
2.  **App Service Configuration:** The Azure App Service receives this certificate. To complete the security circle, you would configure the App Service to require and validate client certificates (often by setting `clientCertEnabled` to true and checking the thumbprint in code or configuration).

Since the proposed solution ("Client cert gateway credentials") enables the APIM side of this authentication handshake, it meets the goal of configuring backend authentication.

📌 Question 228
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your company's Azure subscription includes an Azure Log Analytics workspace.

Your company has a hundred on-premises servers that run either Windows Server 2012 R2 or Windows Server 2016, and is linked to the Azure Log Analytics workspace. The Azure Log Analytics workspace is set up to gather performance counters associated with security from these linked servers.

You must configure alerts based on the information gathered by the Azure Log Analytics workspace.

You have to make sure that alert rules allow for dimensions, and that alert creation time should be kept to a minimum. Furthermore, a single alert notification must be created when the alert is created and when the alert is resolved.

You need to make use of the necessary signal type when creating the alert rules.

Which of the following is the option you should use?

- A. The Activity log signal type.
- B. The Application Log signal type.
- C. The Metric signal type.
- D. The Audit Log signal type.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
✅ Correct Answer
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**C. The Metric signal type.**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📝 Explanation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Why "Metric signal type" is correct:**
The requirements describe specific behaviors that define **Metric Alerts** in Azure Monitor:
1.  **Performance Counters:** These are numerical values that naturally fit the "Metric" definition.
2.  **Dimensions:** Metric alerts support multi-dimensional monitoring, allowing you to alert on specific segments (e.g., a specific server instance).
3.  **Latency ("minimum alert creation time"):** Metric alerts are evaluated more frequently (often every minute) and have significantly lower latency than Log Search alerts, which depend on log ingestion and query schedules.
4.  **Auto-resolution ("notification... when resolved"):** Metric alerts are **stateful**. They send a notification when the threshold is crossed (Fired) and another when the condition is no longer met (Resolved). Standard Log Search alerts are typically stateless (they just fire repeatedly if the condition is met) or have different resolution semantics.

**Why others are incorrect:**
*   **A. Activity Log:** Monitors control-plane events (e.g., "Virtual Machine created", "Key Vault updated"). It does not handle performance counter data.
*   **B. Application Log:** Generally refers to logs generated by app code (traces, exceptions). While valid for debugging, it doesn't fit the "performance counter" and "stateful metric" requirements as well as the Metric signal does.
*   **D. Audit Log:** Similar to Activity Log, focusing on compliance and access, not performance metrics.
